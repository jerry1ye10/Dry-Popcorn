# Project Description
Our project will take advantage of the Spotify API and the Open Weather Map API to recommend for a user based on their current location. The User will be able to enter a location as a prompt, and our project will take that location and use the Open Weather Map API to generate the weather from that location at the current time. Our project would then call on a self-developed algorithm to take the current weather and recommend song choices based on that. 

We decided to use Bootstrap because of its great grid system. It also has great documentation and great developer support. It seems to be more customizable and is more popular, leading to more possibilities.
